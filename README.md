### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have always found myself being drawn to anything related to technology even since I was a child. I always tried to tinker with things and have a good understanding of how everything works. That prenotion has followed me into adulthood where I am now striving towards becoming a Software Engineer.

I currently have an Associates Degree in basic engineering through Quinsigamond Community College and I am enrolled at Worcester State University in an effort to complete my Bachelor's Degree in their Computer Science Major, Concentration in Software Development program. 

ðŸŒ± I am currently learning a few languages right now;

- Python: I have the most experience in this language and feel the most comfortable with it but am by no means anything above a beginner.
- Java: Just starting the basics, but I am enjoying it so far!
- SQLite - I have a bit of basic knowledge and can create simple things.

ðŸ‘¯ I currently have an intership through Joyn.gg and I am always trying to involve myself with our Python codebase to further learn the logic behind methodology used and to just overall learn all the coding languages and frameworks we use better.
