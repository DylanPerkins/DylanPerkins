### Hi there 👋

I have always found myself being drawn to anything related to technology even since I was a child. I always tried to tinker with things and have a good understanding of how everything works. That prenotion has followed me into adulthood where I am now striving towards becoming a Software Engineer.

I currently have an Associates Degree in basic engineering through Quinsigamond Community College and I am enrolled at Southern New Hampshire University in an effort to complete my Bachelor's Degree in their Computer Science program.

🌱 I am currently learning a few languages right now;

- Python: I have the most experience in this language and feel the most comfortable with it but am by no means anything above a beginner.
- Java: Just starting the basics, but I am enjoying it so far!
- SQLite - I have a bit of basic knowledge and can create simple things.

👯 I am currently working with Joyn.gg and I am always trying to involve myself with our codebase to further learn the logic behind the methodology used and to just overall learn the coding languages and frameworks we use.
